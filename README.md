C++ program compilation instructions: Compile the program flesch.cpp by using the c++ compiler command upon flesch.cpp.
C++ program execution instructions: Run flesch.cpp's executable program by
entering the program's executable file's name on the command line and specifying
the name of the text file to analyze after the executable file's name on the
command line.
Java program compilation instructions: Compile Flesch.java by using the javac
compiler command upon Flesch.java with both WordVector.java and
ReadValueCalcVariables.java present in the current working directory.
Java program execution instructions: Run Flesch.class with both WordVector.class
and ReadValueCalcVariables.class within the current working directory, then,
after the Flesch.class program run begins, enter the name of the text file to
analyze.
Perl program compilation instructions: No compilation command is necessary for
flesch.plx; therefore, do not attempt to use a compilation command upon
flesch.plx.
Perl program execution instructions: Run flesch.plx by entering
"perl flesch.plx" upon the command line, or replace the "flesch.plx" in the run
command with the path to where the flesch.plx program is stored, then after the
program run begins, enter the name of the text file to analyze.
Ada program compilation instructions: Use the gnatmake compiler upon flesch.adb
with pounds_tokenize_pack.adb and pounds_tokenize_pack.ads in the current
working directory.
Ada program execution instructions: Before running the flesch Ada executable,
enter the command "ulimit -s unlimited" into Cobra's command line if that
command had not already been entered into Cobra during the current Cobra
session. Then, run the flesch Ada executable by entering the executable's name,
followed by the name of the file to analyze, on the command line.
Fortran compilation instructions: Compile flesch.f90 with the gfortran
compilation command.
Fortran execution instructions: Enter the name of the executable file compiled from flesch.f90 on the command line.
